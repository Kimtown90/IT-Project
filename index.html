<h2 style="color:rgb(128,128,128);">Personal Information</h2>
<p>Brent Kimm 30, male<br>
Melbourne, Australia<br>
S3873880@student.rmit.edu.au<br></p>

<p>After completing VCE in 2008, I have since been working hard in the Civil & Communications and Railway industries.<br>
My time as a contractor for Telstra gave me an insight into the communication network and how weare provided<br>
internet through our landlines from a telephone exchange, which is linked throughout the planet.<br></p>

<p>I am a terrible golfer; however I have won 2 monthly medals in golf competitionsas well as a 1st place trophy<br>
in a major local tournament… thank God for handicaps!</p><br>

<h2 style="color:rgb(128,128,128);">Interest in IT</h2>
<p>First and foremost, I have always had an affinity for video games. Ever since I was given a NES for Christmas<br>
when I was 5, I have been passionate about gaming. My first specific interest in the I.T field began when I built<br>
my own gaming computer when I was still in high school. My friends were building their own so they could optimally<br>
play the extremely popular Counterstrike 1.6 game. My goal for my build was simple: Build the best gaming PC I<br>
could for my budget, which back then was not much at all.I did a significant amount of research to find the best<br>
value hardware I could find. Naturally, a big portion of my budget went into the graphics card; arguably the key<br>
component to a good gaming machine. I bought an NVIDIA GeForce 880 GTX, which at the time was the pinnacle of video<br>
cards. Everything else after that was efficient budget hardware that fleshed out the rest of the build. A couple <br>
thousand dollars later I had an absolute beast of a machine that could handle any contemporary game on the market<br>
on maximum display settings. Fast forward 2 years and this build is completely outdated and not worth anything<br>
close to what I had initially paid. This was my first real exposure to the rapidly progressing and volatile nature<br>
of technology. I was upset that my creation had become antiquated, but also very excited by how technology could<br>
advance so rapidly in such a short period of time. It left me wanting to dive even deeper in the field of<br>
Information Technology.<br></p>

<p>For 12 years after graduating high school, I worked full time as a Heavy machine operator in the civil and railway<br>
industries. While this field of work has been financially rewarding for me, I have never felt fulfilled by the<br>
career choice nor has it ever given me any real path of advancement over the years. I felt a career change was<br>
in order. Working in a field that I enjoy will rejuvenate my sense of fulfillment with my career. I strive to be<br>
a dedicated and innovative professional. These factors paired with my love of all things technology has lead me<br>
the path of studying with RMIT.<br></p>

<p>I expect to learn the basics of how IT is applied in our daily lives and use that information to develop a more<br>
direct skillset. Ideally learning how to create apps or programs that aid people to perform everyday tasks or how<br>
to protect businesses and organization’s sensitive information against cyber threats. Simply learning to develop<br>
games for people to relax and enjoy would be another possible route. I am still unsure on the exact path I want to<br>
head down, but the opportunities that this course provides are very exciting to me.<br></p>

<p>
"A Protagonist is a person with the Extraverted, Intuitive, Feeling, and Judging personality traits.<br>
These warm, forthright types love helping others, and they tend to have strong ideas and values.<br>
They back their perspective with the creative energy to achieve their goals.<br>
Protagonists are natural-born leaders, full of passion and charisma. Forming around two percent of the<br>
population, they are oftentimes our politicians, our coaches and our teachers, reaching out and inspiring<br>
others to achieve and to do good in the world. With a natural confidence that begets influence,<br>
Protagonists take a great deal of pride and joy in guiding others to work together to improve themselved<br>
and their community.""<br></p>
<p>
<p>Strengths: Tolerant, Reliable, Charismatic, Altruistic, Natural Leaders<br></p>

<p>Weaknesses: Overly Idealistic, Too Selfless, Too Sensitive, Fluctuating Self-Esteem, Struggle to Make<br>
Tough Decisions<br></p>

<h3 style="color:rgb(128,128,128);">Career Paths</h3><br>

<p>"When it comes to finding a career, people with the Protagonist personality type cast their eyes towards<br>
anything that lets them do what they love most – helping other people! Lucky for them, people like being<br>
helped, and are even willing to pay for it, which means that Protagonists are rarely wanting for<br>
inspiration and opportunity in their search for meaningful work.""<br></p>

<h3 style="color:rgb(128,128,128);">Protagonist Colleagues</h3>
<p>"As colleagues, Protagonists’ desire to assist and cooperate is even more evident as they draw their<br>
coworkers into teams where everyone can feel comfortable expressing their opinions and suggestions,<br>
working together to develop win-win situations that get the job done. Protagonists’ tolerance,<br>
open-mindedness and easy sociability make it easy for them to relate to their colleagues, but also<br>
make it perhaps a little too easy for their colleagues to shift their problems onto Protagonists’<br>
plates. People with the Protagonist personality type are sensitive to the needs of others, and their<br>
role as a social nexus means that problems inevitably find their way to Protagonists’ doorsteps, where<br>
colleagues will find a willing, if overburdened, associate.<br></p>

<h3 style="color:rgb(128,128,128);">Protagonist Managers</h3><br>
<p>"While perfectly capable as subordinates and colleagues, Protagonists’ true calling, where their capacity<br>
for insightful and inspiring communication and sensitivity to the needs of others really shows, is in<br>
managing teams. As managers, Protagonists combine their skill in recognizing individual motivations with<br>
their natural charisma to not only push their teams and projects forward, but to make their teams want to<br>
push forward. They may sometimes stoop to manipulation, the alternative often being a more direct<br>
confrontation, but Protagonists’ end goal is always to get done what they set out to do in a way that<br>
leaves everyone involved satisfied with their roles and the results they achieved together."<br></p>



<h3 style="color:rgb(128,128,128);"><a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml">The results from a learning style test</a></h3><br>
<p>
My Scores:<br>
		•	Auditory: 30%<br>
		•	Visual: 35%<br>
		•	Tactile: 35%<br>
Therefore I am a Visual/Tactile learner, but very balanced overall<br></p>

<p><h3 style="color:rgb(128,128,128);">Visual</p></h3><br>

<p>"If you are a visual learner, you learn by reading or seeing pictures. You understand and remember things<br>
by sight. You can picture what you are learning in your head, and you learn best by using methods that are<br>
primarily visual. You like to see what you are learning.<br>
As a visual learner, you are usually neat and clean. You often close your eyes to visualize or remember<br>
something, and you will find something to watch if you become bored. You may have difficulty with spoken<br>
directions and may be easily distracted by sounds. You are attracted to color and to spoken language<br>
(like stories) that is rich in imagery.""<br></p>

<p>"Here are some things that visual learners like you can do to learn better:<br>
		•	Sit near the front of the classroom. (It won't mean you're the teacher's pet!)<br>
		•	Have your eyesight checked on a regular basis.<br>
		•	Use flashcards to learn new words.<br>
		•	Try to visualize things that you hear or things that are read to you.<br>
		•	Write down key words, ideas, or instructions.<br>
		•	Draw pictures to help explain new concepts and then explain the pictures.<br>
		•	Color code things.<br>
		•	Avoid distractions during study times.<br>
Remember that you need to see things, not just hear things, to learn well.""<br></p>

<p><h3 style="color:rgb(128,128,128);">Tactile</p></h3><br>

<p>"If you are a tactile learner, you learn by touching and doing. You understand and remember things through<br>
physical movement. You are a "hands-on" learner who prefers to touch, move, build, or draw what you learn,<br>
and you tend to learn better when some type of physical activity is involved. You need to be active and<br>
take frequent breaks, you often speak with your hands and with gestures, and you may have difficulty<br>
sitting still.""<br>
As a tactile learner, you like to take things apart and put things together, and you tend to find reasons<br>
to tinker or move around when you become bored. You may be very well coordinated and have good athletic<br>
ability. You can easily remember things that were done but may have difficulty remembering what you saw<br>
or heard in the process. You often communicate by touching, and you appreciate physically expressed forms<br>
of encouragement, such as a pat on the back.<br></p>

<p>Here are some things that tactile learners like you can do to learn better:<br>
		•	Participate in activities that involve touching, building, moving, or drawing.<br>
		•	Do lots of hands-on activities like completing art projects, taking walks, or acting out stories.<br>
		•	It's OK to chew gum, walk around, or rock in a chair while reading or studying.<br>
		•	Use flashcards and arrange them in groups to show relationships between ideas.<br>
		•	Trace words with your finger to learn spelling (finger spelling).<br>
		•	Take frequent breaks during reading or studying periods (frequent, but not long).<br>
		•	It's OK to tap a pencil, shake your foot, or hold on to something while learning.<br>
		•	Use a computer to reinforce learning through the sense of touch.<br>
Remember that you learn best by doing, not just by reading, seeing, or hearing.<br></p>


<h3 style="color:rgb(128,128,128);"><a href="http://www.testmycreativity.com/">The results from a Creativity test</a></h3><br>

		<p>•	Abstraction The ability to abstract concepts from ideas

<p>I feel being labelled as a Protagonist in the Myers-Briggs test is accurate. I agree that I am far more<br>
extroverted than introverted and more intuitive rather than observe. I was surprised to learn that this test<br>
classifies me as turbulent rather than assertive, as I believe I am very assertive when my mind is made up.<br></p>

<p>The learning style test has me as an even balance between visual and tactile, which I think is correct.
I find both learning styles adequate in their own ways. The creativity test reflects that I like to improve on
things that people find to be normal. I have the confidence to push the boundaries on things that are usually
accepted conventions and persistent enough to continue to bring new ideas and creations.<br></p>

<p>The test results show that I would prefer to delegate work, and command people rather than being given tasks<br>
however I am quite easy to work with given my social skills, desire to help others and always open to hearing<br>
other people’s thoughts, opinions and sympathetic with their emotions. I bring creativeness by questioning how<br>
everyday things can be improved upon.<br></p>

<p>When forming a team, I need to be able to accept daily tasks and welcome constructive criticism which I believe<br>
are weak areas for me. Being in a whole new role, I no longer have the years of experience like I have in my<br>
current field of occupation, so I will need to take a back seat and let others with more experience delegate<br>
tasks until I feel comfortable enough to perform a natural role.<br></p>

</p>
<h2 style="color:rgb(128,128,128);">Project Ideas</h2>

<p>My project idea is straightforward yet potentially very impactful on our daily lives. My focus is to create<br>
and develop a mobile application that is used to find precisely where we store our personal belongings, mementos<br>,
family heirlooms and any other everyday household item. The concept is simple:<br>
		1)	Input an item into an index.<br>
		2)	Leave a description of where you are stowing it and have that cached into a database for future use.<br>
		3)	When the time comes and you need to find this item, simply search for the item in the index and the items
location appears.<br></p>
<p>Typically, I am a forgetful person by nature and this application is for those people out there, like me, who<br>
need aid in finding their possessions. This app has the potential to shed copious amounts of time for those<br>
who are continuously searching for their misplaced personal property. Pixie’s research at apartmenttherapy.com<br>
reveals that we spend on average a whopping 2.5 days a year searching for our belongings. That is around 5000<br>
hours of our entire lives wasted. Not only is this insanely time consuming, it often frustratingly leads to<br>
missing important deadlines, such as making appointments on time, missing transport in particularly flights or<br>
trains trips, and even just every day activities such as arriving for work or school on time. The financial<br>
implications of misplacing items also add up. With the help of this app, no longer will its users have to replace<br>
expensive commodities they have lost throughout their lives.<br></p>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kimtown90/IT-Project/master/pic4.png" alt="pic4.png"><br>
Figure 4. Statistics on the biggest consequences for losing items according to <a href="http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/">Apartment Therapy</a><br>

<p>This application will be very simple to use and anyone with rudimentary app experince can use it effectively.<br>
Initially, the user will list their physical belongings they wish to store away, in a database with the<br>
location of exactly where they wish to store it. Lets use a passport for an example. I want to deposit this<br>
in a secure location like the top drawer on the left side of my cabinet in my study area for future use.<br>
I open the application, Add in “Passport”, followed by something along the lines of “Top, Left Drawer in<br>
Study” in a description field. When the time comes in the future to find this Passport, simply enter<br>
“Passport” into the search bar and the description of the location will appear. Simple. This could also<br>
include a potential paid subscription for a Cloud type storage database so belongings are backed up online,<br>
rather than just on the physical memory of the device alone.<br></p>

<p>It could also incorporate a GPS function for the position of each item, if items are stored away in locations<br>
away from your own property. This will be useful for people who have personal belongings in work buildings,<br>
storage units, containers, garages or warehouses in separate locations. The same principles of adding in the<br>
item apply. Input “Passport”, input “Add current GPS Waypoint” and then possibly a further detailed description<br>
of exactly where that item is at that GPS waypoint, e.g: “Office Desk Filing Cabinet under P”.<br>
Another potential feature may be an alert or reminder system for the items stored away. For example, if you were<br>
storing away important documents for future use, you could set a reminder for that specific document for when<br>
you need to locate it and the app will alert you exactly where it is, when you need it at that point in time.<br></p>

<p>The overall overlay of the application will be as user friendly as possible. An uncomplicated home screen with<br>
the options to Input Items or Search Items, both being clickable which will then take you into the respective<br>
fields. Utilizing voice recognition on the device, and also Speech-to-Text functions could also be implemented<br>
to save time and effort in having to enter in categories manually by typing. There is also potential to pairing<br>
GPS tracking devices to the app as well. Physically attaching a tracking device to a certain object, be it car<br>
keys, wallet or even a separate phone and have the exact GPS location displayed within the app could also be<br>
implemented.<br></p>

<p>My aim is to create a mobile application that is usable for both iOS and Android operating systems.<br>
According to statcounter.com, these two operating systems make up just shy of 100% of the global market share.<br>
As of August 2020, iOS is responsible for 25.15% of the market share while Android has an incredible 74.25% share.<br>
Having the application available for both operating systems allows the largest target audience possible.<br>
I plan to develop this application on my own personal PC, running windows 10. I have narrowed down the<br>
potential software used to Xcode, Java and VirtualBox, however further research and physical testing into <br>
each of these will be required before the product comes into fruition. Xcode is developed for Mac only,<br>
so I would need an additional program to enable this, such as MacStadium, to be able to run this on my Windows PC.<br>
This is what I would likely use to create the iOS version of the app. Whereas Java or VirtualBox would be used to<br>
develop the Android version.<br></p>

<p>Through my RMIT studies, I intend to build my knowledge in an array of different coding languages, not only for<br>
use with this application but also for my own personal knowledge. Java and C++ tend to be the most popular for<br>
application development purposes with Android operating systems whereas Swift is primarily used by developers<br>
for creating apps for iOS and OS X.<br></p>

<p>A successful app for finding key personal belongings will play a major factor in helping us live our lives more<br>
efficiently, with less stress and giving us more time doing the things we would rather be doing. No longer will<br>
we be spending large portions of our lives searching for these things daily. This application could potentially<br>
make our lives far less stressful, by saving us both money and time.<br></p>
